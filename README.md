# Fall 2021 Embedded Systems Challenge
The Challenge was to code a motion contolled device that would recognize gestures and associate it with a message.
A sort of Encryption device if you will. 
The way it works is. each person has their own device. A person performs the gesture on the device and a particular LED glows. That LED number corresponds to a certain message. each persons LED-Message correspondance is different. and all team memebers have access to each others association lists. 
So Once person 1 performs the gesture, an LED lights up and then person 2 check what message that LED corresponds to and tramnsmits the same message based on their list, so on until each person does that and until the last person gets the message
